# linux-updater
A quick and simple bash script to update and upgrade your distribution with one command. 
Please note that right now this script only works for Debian/Ubuntu based distros. 

To use it, follow these steps: 

$git clone https://github.com/rav3ndust/linux-updater

$chmod +x install.sh

$./install.sh

...and that's it. The installer script will make the updater script executable and enable it to be run globally. When this is done, simply type "gnupdater" from anywhere in your terminal to automatically update and upgrade your distro without further user interaction.
